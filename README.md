__Catalogue 3.0 Conformance Test Suite -- HTTP Protocol Binding__

This test suite checks catalogue service implementations for conformance to "OGC 
Catalogue Services 3.0 Specification -- HTTP Protocol Binding" (OGC 12-176r4) and 
related specifications. Only the `Basic-Catalogue` requirements are covered at 
this time; every conforming implementation must satisfy these.
